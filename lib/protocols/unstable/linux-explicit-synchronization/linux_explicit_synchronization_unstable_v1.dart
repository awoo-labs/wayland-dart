/// This global is a factory interface, allowing clients to request
/// explicit synchronization for buffers on a per-surface basis.
/// 
/// See zwp_linux_surface_synchronization_v1 for more information.
/// 
/// This interface is derived from Chromium's
/// zcr_linux_explicit_synchronization_v1.
/// 
/// Note: this protocol is superseded by linux-drm-syncobj.
/// 
/// Warning! The protocol described in this file is experimental and
/// backward incompatible changes may be made. Backward compatible changes
/// may be added together with the corresponding interface version bump.
/// Backward incompatible changes are done by bumping the version number in
/// the protocol and interface names and resetting the interface version.
/// Once the protocol is to be declared stable, the 'z' prefix and the
/// version number in the protocol and interface names are removed and the
/// interface version number is reset.

/// per-surface explicit synchronization support
/// 
/// This object implements per-surface explicit synchronization.
/// 
/// Synchronization refers to co-ordination of pipelined operations performed
/// on buffers. Most GPU clients will schedule an asynchronous operation to
/// render to the buffer, then immediately send the buffer to the compositor
/// to be attached to a surface.
/// 
/// In implicit synchronization, ensuring that the rendering operation is
/// complete before the compositor displays the buffer is an implementation
/// detail handled by either the kernel or userspace graphics driver.
/// 
/// By contrast, in explicit synchronization, dma_fence objects mark when the
/// asynchronous operations are complete. When submitting a buffer, the
/// client provides an acquire fence which will be waited on before the
/// compositor accesses the buffer. The Wayland server, through a
/// zwp_linux_buffer_release_v1 object, will inform the client with an event
/// which may be accompanied by a release fence, when the compositor will no
/// longer access the buffer contents due to the specific commit that
/// requested the release event.
/// 
/// Each surface can be associated with only one object of this interface at
/// any time.
/// 
/// In version 1 of this interface, explicit synchronization is only
/// guaranteed to be supported for buffers created with any version of the
/// wp_linux_dmabuf buffer factory. Version 2 additionally guarantees
/// explicit synchronization support for opaque EGL buffers, which is a type
/// of platform specific buffers described in the EGL_WL_bind_wayland_display
/// extension. Compositors are free to support explicit synchronization for
/// additional buffer types.
