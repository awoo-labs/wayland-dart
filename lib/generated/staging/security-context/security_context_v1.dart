/// client security context manager
/// 
/// This interface allows a client to register a new Wayland connection to
/// the compositor and attach a security context to it.
/// 
/// This is intended to be used by sandboxes. Sandbox engines attach a
/// security context to all connections coming from inside the sandbox. The
/// compositor can then restrict the features that the sandboxed connections
/// can use.
/// 
/// Compositors should forbid nesting multiple security contexts by not
/// exposing wp_security_context_manager_v1 global to clients with a security
/// context attached, or by sending the nested protocol error. Nested
/// security contexts are dangerous because they can potentially allow
/// privilege escalation of a sandboxed client.
/// 
/// Warning! The protocol described in this file is currently in the testing
/// phase. Backward compatible changes may be added together with the
/// corresponding interface version bump. Backward incompatible changes can
/// only be done by creating a new major version of the extension.
