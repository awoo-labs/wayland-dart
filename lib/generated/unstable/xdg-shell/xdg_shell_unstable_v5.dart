/// A popup surface is a short-lived, temporary surface that can be
/// used to implement menus. It takes an explicit grab on the surface
/// that will be dismissed when the user dismisses the popup. This can
/// be done by the user clicking outside the surface, using the keyboard,
/// or even locking the screen through closing the lid or a timeout.
/// 
/// When the popup is dismissed, a popup_done event will be sent out,
/// and at the same time the surface will be unmapped. The xdg_popup
/// object is now inert and cannot be reactivated, so clients should
/// destroy it. Explicitly destroying the xdg_popup object will also
/// dismiss the popup and unmap the surface.
/// 
/// Clients will receive events for all their surfaces during this
/// grab (which is an "owner-events" grab in X11 parlance). This is
/// done so that users can navigate through submenus and other
/// "nested" popup windows without having to dismiss the topmost
/// popup.
/// 
/// Clients that want to dismiss the popup when another surface of
/// their own is clicked should dismiss the popup using the destroy
/// request.
/// 
/// The parent surface must have either an xdg_surface or xdg_popup
/// role.
/// 
/// Specifying an xdg_popup for the parent means that the popups are
/// nested, with this popup now being the topmost popup. Nested
/// popups must be destroyed in the reverse order they were created
/// in, e.g. the only popup you are allowed to destroy at all times
/// is the topmost one.
/// 
/// If there is an existing popup when creating a new popup, the
/// parent must be the current topmost popup.
/// 
/// A parent surface must be mapped before the new popup is mapped.
/// 
/// When compositors choose to dismiss a popup, they will likely
/// dismiss every nested popup as well. When a compositor dismisses
/// popups, it will follow the same dismissing order as required
/// from the client.
/// 
/// The x and y arguments passed when creating the popup object specify
/// where the top left of the popup should be placed, relative to the
/// local surface coordinates of the parent surface. See
/// xdg_shell.get_xdg_popup.
/// 
/// The client must call wl_surface.commit on the corresponding wl_surface
